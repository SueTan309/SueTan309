# 👋 Hi, I'm Sue!
👩🏻‍💻 Data Science student at Macquarie University.

🎨 Data Enthusiast | Machine Learning & AI Explorer.

I'm passionate about turning data into meaningful insights. Currently pursuing a degree in Data Science, I focus on machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization. I love exploring real-world datasets and building models that can solve complex problems. My goal is to continue developing my skills in data science, and I'm always excited to learn new techniques and share my projects with the community.

## Machine Learning Project 
💵 [Fraud Transaction Detection](https://github.com/SueTan309/Fraud-Detection) <br/>
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform in-depth analysis to understand the background of the feature variables and identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
- **Machine Learning Model Development:** Implement machine learning algorithms to build a robust model that can detect whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Visualization:** Create various visualizations (e.g., bar graphs, scatter plots, heatmaps) to segment customer data and better understand customer behavior and characteristics.

## Database Management with MySQL
🐻 [South Africa Conservation Data Management System](https://github.com/SueTan309/South-Africa-Conservation-Data-Management-System/tree/master) <br/>
- **ER and EER Diagrams:** Use Draw.io to design Entity Relationship (ER) and Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER) diagrams for the current conservation system, identifying key entities, their attributes, and relationships.
- **Logical Transformation:** Convert the ER and EER diagrams into detailed database tables with primary and foreign key constraints, ensuring proper normalization and a clear structure for the database.

📚 [EduTrack Database Management](https://github.com/SueTan309/EduTrack-DB) <br/>
- **Setting Up Database Relational System**: Set up a relational database using MySQL, including the creation of tables, defining primary keys (PK), and establishing foreign key (FK) relationships to maintain data integrity.
- **Implementing Stored Procedures and Triggers:** Develop stored procedures and triggers to automate processes such as updating student enrollment, managing transactions, and calculating grades upon changes in related data.
- **Creating Testing (Validation) Data:** Generate test data to validate the functionality and performance of the database, ensuring that the system works as expected under various scenarios.
