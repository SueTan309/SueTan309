# 👋 Hi, I'm Sue!
👩🏻‍💻 Data Science student at Macquarie University.

🎨 Data Enthusiast | Machine Learning & AI Explorer.

I'm passionate about turning data into meaningful insights. Currently pursuing a degree in Data Science, I focus on machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization. I love exploring real-world datasets and building models that can solve complex problems. My goal is to continue developing my skills in data science, and I'm always excited to learn new techniques and share my projects with the community.

## Machine Learning Project 
💵 [Fraud Transaction Detection](https://github.com/SueTan309/Fraud-Detection) <br/>
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform in-depth analysis to understand the background of the feature variables and identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
- **Machine Learning Model Development:** Implement machine learning algorithms to build a robust model that can detect whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Visualization:** Create various visualizations (e.g., bar graphs, scatter plots, heatmaps) to segment customer data and better understand customer behavior and characteristics.
